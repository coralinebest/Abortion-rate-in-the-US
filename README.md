# Medicaid-Abortion-Impact-Analysis

### Project Overview
This GitHub repository houses the code and documentation for a study on the impact of the 2014 Medicaid expansion on abortion rates among women in the United States. The study focuses on analyzing the effects of this policy shift, implemented in 16 states, on the socioeconomic background of women and its correlation with abortion disparities across states.
Medicaid expansion on abortion rates for women aged 15 to 44 at the state level in the United States. The ACA allowed women to access health insurance coverage for abortion, prompting an analysis of its effects. As not all states adopted this policy, a Difference-in-Differences design was employed to assess its impact. Our results indicated no significant overall impact on abortion rates in states where the policy was implemented, with nuances observed when controlling for variables such as age and employment status.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation to gain insights into our analysis of this critical policy and its effects on women's reproductive choices in the United States. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
